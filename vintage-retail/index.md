  <h1>Vintage Retail Lab</h1>
  <p class="muted">
    A small retail venture that I use as a hands on testbed for customer experience, marketing, and practical AI tools.
    It complements my research work by forcing fast feedback loops, clear business metrics, and operational constraints.
  </p>

  <h2>What I do</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Customer and demand understanding:</strong> identify customer segments, product preferences, and drivers of repeat purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Pricing and unit economics:</strong> track margin, inventory turnover, and cost of acquisition to guide sourcing decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth and promotion:</strong> run simple experiments on messaging, listings, and channels, using measurable conversion signals.</li>
    <li><strong>AI assisted operations:</strong> build lightweight tools that speed up listing creation, content adaptation, and inventory organization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>AI tool ideas I have tested or want to test</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>Product description generation with tone control and compliance checks.</li>
    <li>Semantic inventory search and tagging for faster listing and discovery.</li>
    <li>Basic recommendation rules for bundles and cross sell.</li>
    <li>Simple forecasting for demand and restocking priorities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why it matters professionally</h2>
  <p>
    This experience strengthens my ability to translate AI methods into product language: funnel metrics, customer value, and iteration speed.
    It also keeps me close to how users react to system behavior in real conditions.
