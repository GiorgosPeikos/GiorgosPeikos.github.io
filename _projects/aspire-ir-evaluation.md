  <p class="muted">A Streamlit based interface to analyze and compare retrieval systems and ranking experiments.</p>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    IR experimentation produces many runs and metrics, but it is hard to turn them into decisions without structured analysis and comparisons.
  </p>

  <h2>My contributions</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>Designed an analysis workflow for comparing runs, inspecting failures, and understanding trade offs.</li>
    <li>Implemented interactive visualizations to support researcher and practitioner decision making.</li>
    <li>Packaged the work as a usable prototype for repeated evaluation cycles.</li>
  </ul>
